# Int-Maxer Extension for VS Code
Author: Palamarchuk Arseniy, ITMO, M3105

**Int-Maxer** is a Visual Studio Code extension that automatically upgrades all integer variable types in your C++ files to their largest counterparts. For example, it transforms `int8_t` into `int64_t` and `uint16_t` into `uint64_t`. This tool is perfect for developers who need to ensure maximum data capacity for integer types.

## Features

- Automatically replace all occurrences of smaller integer types with their largest equivalents:
  - `int8_t` → `int64_t`
  - `uint8_t` → `uint64_t`
  - `int16_t` → `int64_t`
  - `uint16_t` → `uint64_t`
  - `int32_t` → `int64_t`
  - `uint32_t` → `uint64_t`
- Works seamlessly with C++ files.
- Adds a button in the status bar to activate the transformation with a single click.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code version **1.95.0** or higher.
- Node.js installed for development or debugging purposes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/int-maxer.git
   cd int-maxer
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Compile the extension:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```
4. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
5. Press `F5` to launch the extension in a new Extension Development Host window.

## Usage

1. Open a C++ file in Visual Studio Code.
2. Trigger the extension using one of the following methods:
   - Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), type `Maximize Variable Types (C++)`, and press `Enter`.
   - Click the **Maximize Types** button in the status bar (bottom-right corner of the editor).
3. All eligible types in the file will be replaced with their larger equivalents.

## Development

### Folder Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the TypeScript source code for the extension.
- **`out/`**: The compiled JavaScript code generated by TypeScript.
- **`package.json`**: Configuration and metadata for the extension.

### Scripts

- Compile TypeScript:
  ```bash
  npm run compile
  ```
- Watch for TypeScript changes:
  ```bash
  npm run watch
  ```

### Debugging

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the **Run and Debug** panel.
3. Start debugging with the **Launch Extension** configuration.

## Limitations

- Works only with standard fixed-width integer types (`int8_t`, `uint8_t`, etc.).
- Does not handle custom integer typedefs or unusual naming conventions.
